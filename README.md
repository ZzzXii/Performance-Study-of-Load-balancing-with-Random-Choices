# Performance-Study-of-Load-balancing-with-Random-Choices-CSC446
Background: Load balancing is used in many systems, e.g., cloud computing, web server
farms, Domain Name Servers (DNS). As an abstract model, we assume a set of $m$ servers
work in parallel to serve customers. Each server could be modelled as a FIFO queueing
system. When a new customer arrives, the customer must first go through a load balancer.
The load balancer can use different strategies to dispatch the customer to a server. To
simplify, we in this project consider a randomized strategy as follows:
(Step 1) The load balancer randomly selects $d$ servers ($d < m$)
(Step 2) The load balancer checks the queue length of the selected $d$ servers
(Step 3) The load balancer dispatches the incoming customer to the server that has the
shortest queue length.

We denote the above scheduling method RandMin. The goal of this project is to compare its
performance with two baseline methods and draw your conclusion based on your simulation
results.
(Baseline 1) Purely random (PureRand): The load balancer randomly selects one server from
the $m$ servers and dispatches the incoming customer to the selected server.
(Baseline 2) Round-robin (RR): The load balancer uses the round-robin method to dispatch
incoming customers, i.e., the order of servers for dispatching customers is $1, 2, ..., m, 1,
2, ..., m, 1, 2, ...$

Assumptions:
1. We assume that all serversâ€™ service time follows exponential distribution of rate
parameter $\mu$
2. We assume that the customer arrivals follow the Poisson arrival process with mean
arrival rate $\lambda$
3. We ignore the processing time of the load balancer.

The following performance metrics should be evaluated:
a. Maximum workload: defined as the longest queue length among the $m$ servers
b. Average workload: defined as the average queue length among the $m$ servers
c. Average system time: defined as the average time that all customers stay in the
system.

Note that $m$, $d$, $\mu$,$\lambda$ are system parameters you need to test with
different combinations. Guidelines on how to run simulation and discuss results will be
posted later.
